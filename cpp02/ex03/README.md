# BSP
In this exercise, the **Fixed** class (created in the previous exercises) is used to represent fixed-point numbers and a new class **Point** is created to represent a point in a 2D space (with x and y coordinates).   
The implemented ```bsp()``` function is then used to assess whether any given point is part of a triangle (whose vertexes are a, b and c).   
## Usage
- Download this repository;
- Navigate to this directory on the terminal;
- Run ```make```;
- Run the program ``` ./a.out ```;
- Insert the **x** and then the **y** coordinates of the point you wish to test if is inside the given triangle;

# Abstract Classes and Subtype Polymorphism 
In this module, the goal is to learn about abstract classes and subtype polymorphism. 
For this, base classes like **Animal** are created, with derived classes like **Cat** and **Dog** inheriting from them.

## Concepts learned
- Virtual and [pure virtual functions](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pure-virtual-functions-and-abstract-classes/)
- [Virtual destructors](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/virtual-destructor/)
- Shallow vs deep [copies](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/shallow-copy-and-deep-copy-in-c/)
- Abstract and pure abstract classes (interfaces)

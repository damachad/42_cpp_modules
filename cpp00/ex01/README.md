# My Awesome Phonebook

This program consists of a simple phonebook, where one can:
- ADD contacts (up to 8 contact slots available);
- SEARCH for a specific contact previously registered;
- EXIT the program;
If the user tries to add a 9th contact, it will overwrite the info of the first contact.

### Information collected for each contact:
- First name;
- Last name;
- Nickname;
- Phone number;
- Darkest secret;
